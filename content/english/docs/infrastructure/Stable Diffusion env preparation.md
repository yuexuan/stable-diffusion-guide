## Easy Start

![](https://p3-sign.toutiaoimg.com/tos-cn-i-6w9my0ksvp/5081a7eafd134a73962c344f81afee84~tplv-obj.image?lk3s=3de049d8&traceid=2023112317011619203B17AAEE0119D9DB&x-expires=2147483647&x-signature=w813o0nBiA%2ByEL%2FOCon78MzFI4c%3D)

Don't worry; it's not going to be too difficult. The current operating interface is user-friendly and easy to use. We know that having a good graphics card is crucial for AI drawing. The choice of the operating system is not critical; however, for the sake of general popularity, ease of use, and higher fault tolerance, I recommend using Windows 10 or later, paired with an NVIDIA graphics card. This way, even if you encounter problems, finding solutions will be relatively easy. For users on macOS or Linux systems with AMD graphics cards, if you're willing to tinker a bit, feel free to leave an issue. I'll provide step-by-step instructions in a dedicated blog post.

Now, the question is, what if you don't have a graphics card, or your graphics card is too low-end, or it's not an NVIDIA card? Does that mean you can't proceed?

Of course not! The core principle of this tutorial is to cater to users without much computer knowledge or a dedicated graphics card. In [this link](https://jinheyong.cn/zh-cn/blog/ai-art-create-website-guide/), I have listed AI drawing-related websites, including guidance on graphics cards. For users who don't want to bother with configurations, I highly recommend [rundiffusion.com](https://rundiffusion.com/). Although it's a bit expensive ($0.5/hour), it saves you the hassle, providing several popular open-source web UIs. They charge based on usage time, so remember to close it when not in use.

Since I'm currently in a Chinese environment and don't have a graphics card, I plan to use the graphics cards on [AutoDL](https://www.autodl.com/). I will write related blog posts about purchasing and selecting leased graphics cards, as well as the pitfalls you may encounter. For now, you can take a look at [this article](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/629479857) and [this blog post](https://www.cnblogs.com/bossma/archive/2023/07/31/17593492.html) for detailed steps on deploying Stable Diffusion WebUI on the AutoDL cloud.

## Recommended Configurations

To be honest, many people like to recommend the minimum configurations, but I personally reserve judgment on this. I lean towards reasonable configurations because our goal is not to be a tech geek but to enhance content production efficiency to solve real-world problems. So, here's the minimum baseline configuration, and the more, the better.

- CPU: AMD or Intel CPU. While the requirement for this configuration is not high, don't overlook it. You shouldn't use a CPU from the last century.
- RAM: At least 16 GB DDR4 or DDR5 RAM.
- Storage: 256 GB or larger SATA or NVMe solid-state drive. You need at least 10 GB of available space. Typically, a 1 TB drive offers the best price per GB of storage. (Since the sizes of general models are quite large, more storage space is convenient for storing more models. Using an SSD is preferable to a traditional disk, providing a significant improvement in read and write speeds.)
- GPU: GeForce RTX GPU with at least 16 GB GDDR6 memory. Many people overlook bandwidth issues, and there is no specific standard for bandwidth, so choose the largest available.

|RTX 4080|13.48|68.32%|
|RTX 4090|19.73|100.00%|

As you can see, the graphics card plays a crucial role in rendering speed and quality.

## Environment Setup

Assuming you've read the previous sections and have prepared to learn how to use a graphics card, let's dive into setting up your own Stable Diffusion console.

**Local Installation**

1. Environment Check

Check your graphics card, memory, hard drive, and CPU. The most crucial element is your graphics cardâ€”NVIDIA (Nvidia graphics card) starting from the 10 series, with a minimum of 4GB graphics memory (6GB is better). Memory should be at least 8GB (16GB is better), and your hard drive should ideally have 500GB or more, with SSD being the best choice. The CPU doesn't have strict requirements, as long as it's not outdated.

If you don't know how to check your graphics card, you can open the task manager by right-clicking on the taskbar or using the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + Delete` and holding them down in sequence. If you have 4GB or more, you're good to go.

You will see a folder like this. If you encounter issues with downloading, such as network failures or HTTPS security verification problems, you can also download and unzip the file directly from the GitHub page [https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git) (not recommended for future web UI upgrades).

![](https://p3-sign.toutiaoimg.com/tos-cn-i-6w9my0ksvp/2d90b65b76e746b3a65fbb513e8e7095~tplv-obj.image?lk3s=3de049d8&traceid=2023112318141748BF73F48B0FFF1EBAE2&x-expires=2147483647&x-signature=ja6Ql5H0cpnPDc4VI1wyqvwZN%2F4%3D)

6. Run webui-user.bat

Open the stable-diffusion-webui directory, and you will see the 'webui-user.bat' file. Double-click to run it.

![](https://p3-sign.toutiaoimg.com/tos-cn-i-6w9my0ksvp/80e0fb8564284d278618be0f0772cdec~tplv-obj.image?lk3s=3de049d8&traceid=2023112318141748BF73F48B0FFF1EBAE2&x-expires=2147483647&x-signature=ZksM%2Ffyo0344riWQNHXoQHxU%2B04%3D)

During the run, the duration depends on your network environment, usually taking 10-30 minutes to complete. Wait until you see the address [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860/), indicating that it is running successfully. Do not close this window; closing it will exit the process.

Copy [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860/) to your browser (you can save it as a bookmark for convenience), and now you can input commands to generate images.

![](https://p3-sign.toutiaoimg.com/tos-cn-i-6w9my0ksvp/79fbc07b66d149379f3fda174c6af350~tplv-obj.image?lk3s=3de049d8&traceid=2023112318141748BF73F48B0FFF1EBAE2&x-expires=2147483647&x-signature=I%2FsPo63dg3mfbUDioj1liqRZ29E%3D)
