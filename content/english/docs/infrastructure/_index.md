This chapter mainly introduces the fundamental theoretical knowledge related to the Stable Diffusion webUI. It aims to provide you with a conceptual understanding of the basics, allowing you to have a general overview of AI drawing control consoles. There is no need to be intimidated by the numerous functionality options on the webUI. The goal is to have a broad understanding of each option, preventing you from feeling unfamiliar when encountering them later on.

The focus of this chapter is on gaining insight, without the need for excessive memorization. We will continually revisit these knowledge points in subsequent chapters.
