Welcome to the Stable Diffusion tutorial!

In this tutorial, you will learn everything about AI drawing without the need for complex coding. All you need to bring is your imagination, and you'll be able to create anything you desire. If that's not enough, we'll also teach you how to train your own model from scratch, something you can use for yourself or share with friends on the internet. It's a journey that promises a sense of pride.

We'll start by exploring the history of AI drawing, helping you understand how it originated, evolved, and what the future holds for AI drawing. What are the current AI drawing products, their features, and why do we recommend learning and using Stable Diffusion? Who created it, what are its principles, and what advantages does it offer?

Even if you've never encountered AI drawing, don't know about Stable Diffusion, lack a PC or a high budget, there's no need to worry. We'll guide you step by step, starting from setting up the environment, even if you've never dealt with code before. Don't be afraid; between you and mastery, there's only a need for action. Believe in yourself!

We will introduce the mainstream WebUI of Stable Diffusion, [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). <img alt="stable-diffusion-webui for automatic1111" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/images/stable-diffusion-webui.png" /> Although it may seem complex at first, it's user-friendly. Once you become familiar with its operation, I believe you'll fall in love with it. With the help of community-provided plugins, it can create a console that suits your artistic desires. You can use it to generate anything you want, be it images, videos, or even music. We'll patiently explain every concept on the UI. To get you started quickly, we may skip some less commonly used features, but you can refer to relevant explanations when you need more precise control.

We'll focus on in-depth discussions of commonly used base models, including Checkpoint, Hypernetwork, Embedding, LoRA, Upscaler, VAE, and more.

You'll transform into an extraordinary artist who can turn simple sketches into vibrant and imaginative pictures. You'll be able to restore old photos in high definition, add colors to black and white images, bring your ideal idols to life with personalized messages, and depict characters from novels according to your imagination, whether they are from anime, real life, or cyberpunk – nothing is impossible, as long as you dare to imagine.

Sometimes, the images you generate may flash by, and you might worry about losing them. Don't fret; we'll teach you how to preserve them. If your generated images have multiple faces, extra limbs, or imperfections that bother you, rest assured. We'll guide you in using Controlnet to make them better, allowing you to control aspects like shapes, colors, depth of field, lighting, and style based on your preferences.

High-end designs are typically created by designers using professional design software like Photoshop. Without proper training, it's challenging to manipulate such tools. After learning from this tutorial, basic design functions such as cutting, replacing backgrounds, designing e-commerce images, furniture pictures, and even some e-commerce promotional ads become effortless. Perhaps you can take orders from freelancing websites and achieve a small financial independence?
