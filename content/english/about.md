Artistic creation involving AI has experienced a staggering surge over the past year. A plethora of AI creation platforms have emerged, varying widely in quality, from finely crafted to blatant plagiarism, driven by the pursuit of quick profits. Users navigating these platforms face a steep learning curve, grappling with the challenge of distinguishing between them and navigating subscription models that often result in unnecessary expenses. Yet, the produced artworks frequently fall short of expectations.

As I contemplated crafting a guide for those venturing into AI artistic creation, platforms like [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/)，[Mid Djourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home), and [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) had already risen to prominence. Surprisingly, some users struggled to even locate their official websites. Thus, this tutorial series was conceived. I've chosen to commence with Stable Diffusion not only because it is open-source but also due to the fact that many AI drawing websites on the market are built upon its framework. They merely cloak Stable Diffusion in a dazzling exterior, offering seemingly user-friendly UIs coupled with subscription systems—nothing more.

My hope is that, after completing this series, you won't find it necessary to spend a dime, even if you lack prior experience with computers, AI, GPUs, or even a computer itself. These should not serve as impediments. If you possess the desire to create, everything becomes possible. You might come to the realization that your pursuit of AI drawing knowledge has consumed much time, energy, and money without tangible results. Post-tutorial, you might just fall in love with it. After all, it's remarkably straightforward, efficient, and potent. All you need is a dash of patience.

So, what's holding you back? Let's dive in!

## About the Tutorial

This tutorial comprises two major components:

1. **Documentary Approach:** Presented as a structured documentation with a book-like index, it delves into the knowledge points associated with Stable Diffusion. Topics covered include fundamental concepts, model usage, practical examples, advanced exercises, and high-level model training.

2. **Blog:** Adopting a more informal style, this section addresses scattered knowledge, focusing on Stable Diffusion's media updates, model differentiations, and comparisons with alternative drawing models. It will also curate Q&A sessions, prompt vocabulary, and other relevant content. Feel free to explore and gain insights into the current drawing ecosystem.

## About the Author

Thank you for your interest and attention. I'm a self-proclaimed full-stack developer residing in Shanghai, China. Motivated by a discontentment with the widespread exploitation of Stable Diffusion in the current commercial landscape—disguised as self-development with shameless subscription practices—I aim to provide a modest helping hand through this tutorial to those who both need and respect AI drawing.

The primary language for this tutorial is Chinese (I contemplated writing in English but found my foundation lacking; I hope our international friends understand). An English version will be provided, translated using Chat GPT. Depending on demand, additional language versions may be considered. If you find this tutorial beneficial and wish to contribute to translation efforts, feel free to join in. The tutorial documents are in Markdown format and entirely open source. However, Chinese copyright remains with me, and free reprinting is permitted with proper attribution.
