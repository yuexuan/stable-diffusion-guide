To provide a firsthand experience for those new to AI drawing, I'll start by recommending some user-friendly websites that are generally free to use. However, creating high-quality images still requires learning some professional knowledge related to AI art. The listed websites include both domestic and international options, with some limitations for Chinese platforms that usually require user accounts due to regulatory reasons. The list will be continuously updated.

## Comprehensive Model Sharing Websites

These websites offer pre-trained models for users to download and distribute freely. They often provide paid services such as image generation and model training. While the quantity of these websites is limited, their quality is high, making them worth bookmarking.

1. [https://civitai.com/](https://civitai.com/) Known as the "C site," it is straightforward to use. Currently, it allows users to select models for drawing. Simply find the desired model, click create, or visit [https://civitai.com/generate](https://civitai.com/generate).
    
2. [https://tensor.art/](https://tensor.art/) A well-known model-sharing site with an app version. It supports image prompt sharing, image generation, and image training.
    
3. [https://www.liblib.ai/](https://www.liblib.ai/) A popular model-sharing site in China with a focus on Asian culture. It supports model training and image generation, drawing inspiration from Stable Diffusion WebUI. Requires a Chinese phone number for registration.
    
4. [https://aigccafe.net/](https://aigccafe.net/) A site mostly mirroring models from other websites, serving as a model download mirror in China.
    

## Social AI Drawing Websites

These websites primarily offer customized versions of Stable Diffusion as their core, packaged with user-friendly interfaces. Users share generated images online, allowing others to replicate or modify them using similar or different prompts. This model is prevalent among current AI drawing websites.

## GPU Rental Websites

If you don't have your own computer or GPU but still want to create unique images after exploring the above websites, these platforms allow you to rent various GPUs. You only need to pay for the time you use, with additional storage fees for the remaining time. Of course, you can also choose to rebuild the environment each time.

1. [https://rundiffusion.com/](https://rundiffusion.com/) Machine-driven deployment of AI generation systems with a one-click selection. Price: $0.5 per hour; highly recommended.
    
2. [https://www.autodl.com/](https://www.autodl.com/) A widely used platform with a considerable user base.
